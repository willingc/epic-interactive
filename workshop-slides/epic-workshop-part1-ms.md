# `sketch.js` is a JavaScript file

[.code: auto(42), line-height(2.0)]

**`sketch.js`**

```javascript
function setup() {
  // put setup code here
}

function draw() {
  // put drawing code here
}
```

---

# `index.html`

[.code: auto(42), line-height(2.0)]

```html, [.highlight: 7, 10]
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0>
    <style> body {padding: 0; margin: 0;} </style>
    <script src="../p5.min.js"></script>
    <script src="../addons/p5.dom.min.js"></script>
    <script src="../addons/p5.sound.min.js"></script>
    <script src="sketch.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Canvas

Like a painter, it is where you draw.

[.code: auto(42), line-height(2.0)]

```javascript, [.highlight: 2]
function setup() {
  createCanvas(300, 100);  // Canvas width is 300 pixels, height is 100 pixels
}

function draw() {
  // put drawing code here
}
```

### Draw an ellipse on the screen

A circle is an ellipse where `width = height`

```javascript
ellipse(pixelsFromLeft, pixelsFromTop, width, height)
```

ellipse( :arrow_right: , :arrow_down: , )             
pixelsFromLeft | ---> |
pixelsFromTop | : )

**Example**

```javascript
ellipse(50, 50, 80, 80);
```

---

```javascript
function setup() {
  // put setup code here
}

function draw() {
  // put drawing code here
}
```

---

ellipse(50, 50, 80, 80);
