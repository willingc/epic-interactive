Submission

"The emphasis will be on interactivity. Games, Jupyter notebooks, and many applications rely on interactions between the user and computers. 

How do you make an interactive game, app, or a project like JupyterLab? Creativity, design, coding, and marketing are elements that go into a successful software project. 

Through hands on examples and discussion, we will explore the different skills and people involved in the creation of a professional game or app. 

The goal will be to show that there is a place in tech for a variety of backgrounds and interests. Students will use JavaScript and Python programming languages to create interactive games and simulations in a web browser.

- Introduce and play a game using emojis and the notebook (nteract/vdom) or JupyterLab 
- Modify the game to add additional rules, emojis, and actions 
- Design and User Interface: what makes the game easier to use, more visually appealing 
- Applying the concepts behind games to scientific simulations and animation by introducing 3-4 notebooks with simulations which may be accessed by a web browser using mybinder.org 

Weâ€™ll wrap up with some next steps and actions that students can choose to continue to do after the workshop based on their interests."
